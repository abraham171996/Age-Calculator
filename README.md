# Age-Calculator
The Git repository contains a project that implements a date calculator application using React.js. The application allows users to calculate the difference in years, months, and days between a user-selected date and the current date.
The project structure includes the following components and assets:

Main: The main component of the application, responsible for rendering the date calculator interface. It includes input fields for day, month, and year, and a button to trigger the calculation. The calculated result is displayed in terms of years, months, and days.

CSS Module: The main.module.css file contains CSS styles specific to the Main component. It defines the layout, styling, and animation for the date calculator interface.

Arrow Icon: The arrow image asset represents an arrow icon used for the button in the application.

The Main component utilizes React Hooks to manage the state of the input fields (days, months, and years). It also includes a handler function (handleButtonClick) that is invoked when the button is clicked. Inside this function, the input values are retrieved, validated, and used to calculate the date difference. The calculated values are then updated in the component state.

The user interface provides a simple and intuitive way for users to enter a date and view the difference in years, months, and days between the entered date and the current date.

The repository serves as a reference for building similar date calculation functionality in React.js projects. Developers can examine the code and styles to understand how to implement input handling, state management, and calculations in a React component.
